Sometimes when doing export/import via XML of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com">Atlassian</a> products (<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> etc.) you might run into a problem when importing because of invalid characters in the XML-file.

That's usually solved by using the atlassian-xml-cleaner JAR.

It can be found <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/removing-invalid-characters-from-xml-backups-12079.html">here</a>.
