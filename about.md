In January 1991, when working for <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/">Ericsson</a>, I got my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">DOS</a>-only <a href="http://oju.mbnet.fi/retro/EricssonPC_eng.html">Ericsson PC</a> replaced with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_1">Sun SPARCStation 1</a> which changed my way of working and my way of life. I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a> in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunOS">SunOS 4.1.1B</a>.

In October 1994 I had tired of testing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AXE_telephone_exchange">AXE Telephone Exchange</a> that I was supposed to do and changed jobs within Ericsson to become a full time SysAdmin for some 1500 users, initially still on SunOS 4, but pretty soon I had to convert from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">BSD</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V#SVR4">SVR4</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)">Solaris</a> 2.4.

At the end of 1995 I grew weary of the Ericsson salary-politics and left to work as a Systems Support Engineer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems. Solaris went through 2.5->2.5.1->2.6->7->8->9->10 while I worked for Sun, I left at the end of 2004.

Since then I've worked, again as a SysAdmin (now *Senior* though), with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX">HP-UX</a> and <a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a> up until November of 2016 when I took over as technical lead for all <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">Macs</a> at my current Company, having used a MacPro and a MacBookPro as my work computers since 2011.

We currently use <a href="https://www.filewave.com/">FileWave</a> to manage these Macs (130 to date).
