I've setup <a href="https://containrrr.github.io/watchtower/">Watchtower</a> to automate keeping the docker containers up to date in my <a href="https://jby.github.io/Synology-Plex/">Synology setup</a>.

I'm also trying out <a href="https://www.bazarr.media">Bazarr</a> for downloading subtitles for both Movies and TV Shows.
