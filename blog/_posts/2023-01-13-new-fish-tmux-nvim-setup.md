title: New setup with iTerm, fish, tmux and nvim
---

I've been using <a href="https:fishshell.com">fish</a> for quite a while now, in cooperation with <a href="https://tmux.github.io">tmux</a>.
<p>
I've been using all different incarnations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">Vi</a> since I started working with Unix 1991. I think I've tried most of them: Vi, <a href="https://vim.org">Vim</a>, <a href="https://gvim.en.softonic.com">gVim</a>, <a href="https://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/">MacVim</a>, and now I've arrived at <a href="https://neovim.io">NeoVim</a>, or "nvim" for short.
<p>
The setup I've been using with MacVim has been the <a href="https://nandalopes.github.io/dotfiles/">YADR</a> setup.
However, since I'm not a developer per se, but a SysAdmin, there were a bit too much config involved in YADR.
<p>
I've now found NeoVim and it's excellent <a href="https://www.lazyvim.org/">LazyVim setup</a>, that I'll be trying out for a while.
During that I also found the <a href="https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm">Tmux Plugin Manager</a>, that I'll also test for a while.
<p>
For all of the tools (fish, tmux and nvim) I also found the <a href="https://draculatheme.com">Dracula</a> theme/colorscheme, which also has themes/colorschemes for some 300+ apps, including <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://iterm2.com">iTerm</a>, native terminals for Gnome, macOS and Windows among others.
