I've been using <a href="https:fishshell.com">fish</a> for quite a while now, in cooperation with <a href="https://tmux.github.io">tmux</a>.
<p>
As seen in my <a href="https://jby.github.io/new-fish-tmux-nvim-setup/"previous post</a> I've updated my environment regarding tmux and editor. I did do a re-think about shell though, and I thought I'd go with the default shell in macOS for a while at least. I still have my fish config.
<p>
I'm now considering, and trying, going back to <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a>, but not in combination with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">Oh-my-zsh</a> that was part of my old YADR setup. After seeing how it grew over the last couple of years, and reading about it being kind of "bloatware" nowadays - I thought I'd try something slimmer. I found <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans">zsh4humans</a> and thought I'd try that for a while. It incorporates <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k">p10k</a> and with some tweaks it seems like I can get it to where I like it.
