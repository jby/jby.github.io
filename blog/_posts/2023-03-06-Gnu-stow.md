I've found <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">Gnu stow</a> to manage linking my dotfiles from my git repo into their target directories.
So far I've only done zsh, tmux and git. I'll continue with nvim and tmuxinator, and maybe fish, just because I've got a pretty good config for it - eventhough I will use zsh primarily for now.
